# TPE_XML
## Final Project for XML


This group project consists of applying the query and transformation tools of
XML documents in order to get a Markdown page with the name and dates of a
season, along with its phases, groups, and list of competitors and matches. 

For this project, we used the SportRadar API, which is a website that has information from various sports in the form of calls to REST APIs.
